## Overview
The `parse-config.sh` script is used as an init container to create a `.env` file from other config files. In our current setup, these other config files are K8S secrets mounted as volumes. The format of the resulting `.env` file is a traditional `KEY=VALUE` text file, with each entry being seperated by a new line. This way, applications need to be only aware of one file to load its configuration. Aside from the bundling, the script also formats the key to standardise naming.
